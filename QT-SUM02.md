## Writing 5-sentence paragraph

A paragraph is a group of sentences that fleshes out a single idea. In order for a paragraph to be effective, it must begin with a topic sentence, have sentences that support the main idea of that paragraph, and maintain a consistent flow.

Types of Paragraphs:

- Descriptive paragraphs: outline or describe the topic.
- Expository paragraphs: offer explanation and/or analysis.
- Narrative paragraphs: tell the events of what happened in a particular situation.
- Argument paragraphs lay out a point that you are trying to prove, show your logical argument, and provide evidence to back you up.

The Paragraph Structure should include:

- Topic Sentence: This sentence tells the reader the main idea, or what the paragraph will be about.
- Suporting sentences (from 3 to 4 sentences): This sentence gives specific details relating to the main idea (evidence and examples).
- Concluding sentence: This sentence refers to the topic sentence and sums up the main idea of the paragraph.
